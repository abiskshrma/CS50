# * Learning in MIT is like drinking from a fire hose. Too much information passed on to you but it depends on what you absorb.
# * Computer Science: Problem Solving? Computaional thinking?
# * numbers you can count in your fingre: 31????

# * 0 & 1: 2-bits
# * 0 : As a light bulb is off
# * 1 : As a light bulb is on
# Now how do you count more than 1:
#   * with 3 light bulbs we can count upto 7 starting form 0 so total of 8
# how you ask? [*] [ ] [ ] by turning on or off in different permutataion and combination
# 
#
#
#     123 > 1 is in hunderth's column and 2 is in tenth's column. and hence One hundered and twenty three. And these are at a power of tens.
#     123
#     [10^2] [10^1] [10^0]
# why 10 you ask?
# good question: Since there are ten possibilities from 0 to 9
# and hence the numbers are power to the 10
# 
#  Now the computers have only 2 bits and hence two possibilities and ehnce to the power of 2
#   000 > 0
#   001> 1 > (2^2)*0 + (2^1)*0 + (2^0)*0

# 8 bits is a byte. why 8? Since its power of 2 
# how much can you count to with a byte?
# 255 and including 0 total of 256

# Now how do you assign letters:
# assign the letters a number: A=65
# 

# Now what is an algorithm?
# it is a precise instruction on how to do something.

# Think of a phone book and to find a name in the book?
# how would you write an algorithm to do it?
# 1. check page by page?
# 2. skip 2 pages at a time.
# 3. Jump to the middle check if higher or lower jump to the middle again and repeat.
# If 1. takes n number of pages 2. will tale n/2 pages and 3. will take a log2[n] which will significantly reduce the time.


# Return Value, Variable
